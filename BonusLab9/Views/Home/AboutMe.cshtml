    <p>
        I am currently not blogging on any social media or journaling<br />
        sites, I do however spend too much time learning about current<br />
        events and things I enjoy on Reddit.
    </p><br />
    <p>
        I spend most of my coding time working in C# while in the<br />
        Grand Circus After Hours C# Bootcamp. I have also been learning<br />
        HTML, CSS and SQL.
    </p><br />
    <p>
        I currently live in Livonia, Michigan, which is located<br />
        west of Detroit.
